\chapter{Generalized Permissive-Upgrade}
\blfootnote{The content of this
  chapter is based on the work published as part of the paper,
  ``Generalizing Permissive-Upgrade in Dynamic Information Flow
  Analysis''~\cite{plas14}} 
 
Although the permissive-upgrade strategy as described above is useful,
its development in literature is incomplete so far: Austin and
Flanagan's original paper~\cite{plas10}, and the work building on it
(Chapter~\ref{ch:ipu}), develops permissive-upgrade for
\emph{only} a two-point security lattice, containing levels $L$ and
$H$ with $L \sqsubset H$, and the new label 
$P$. A generalization to a pointwise product of such two-point
lattices (and, hence, a powerset lattice) was suggested by Austin and
Flanagan in the original paper, but not fully developed. As explained
later in Section~\ref{sec:gen:ipus}, this generalization works for the
improved permissive-upgrade strategy and can be proven sound. 

However, that still leaves open the question of generalizing
permissive-upgrade to arbitrary lattices. It is not even clear
hitherto that this generalization exists. This chapter shows by
construction that a generalization of permissive-upgrade to arbitrary
lattices does indeed exist and that it is, in fact,
non-obvious. Specifically, the rule for adding partially-leaked labels
and the definition of store (memory) equivalence needed to prove
non-interference are reasonably involved.
