The no-sensitive-upgrade (NSU) check described earlier provides the basic
foundations for sound dynamic IFC. However, terminating a program
preemptively because of the NSU check is quite restrictive in practice. For
example, consider the program of Listing~\ref{lst1.1}, where \TT{z} is
labeled $H$ and \TT{y} is labeled $L$. This program potentially upgrades
variable \TT{x} at line~\ref{lineref1} under a high $pc$, and then
executes function \texttt{f} when \TT{y} is \texttt{true} and
executes function \texttt{g} otherwise. Suppose that \texttt{f}
does not read \TT{x}. Then, for $\TT{y} \mapsto \texttt{true}^L$, this program
leaks no information, but the NSU check would terminate this program
prematurely at line~\ref{lineref1}. (Note: \texttt{g} may read \TT{x},
so \TT{x} is not a dead variable at line~\ref{lineref1}.)

To improve permissiveness, Austin and Flanagan~\cite{plas10} proposed
the permissive-upgrade strategy as a replacement for NSU. However,
that development lacks permissiveness in certain cases. 
This chapter presents the soundness results of the permissive-upgrade
strategy with the improvement for further permissiveness in place.
