\section{Limited Information Release}
\label{sec:lir-desc}
Limited information release (LIR) is an information release policy
that declassifies some (limited) parts of sensitive information. 
% \dg{``Fraction of information'' is not a well-defined
%   phrase. Rephrase this sentence.}
The motivation for LIR is that, in
general, certain information flows leak only an insignificant part of
a secret. As an example, the \emph{comparison} of a secret with a
constant value is largely considered acceptable and its rejection by
standard IFC analyses is too restrictive in
practice~\cite{scd,dta}. Such information leaks are usually
acceptable if one can guarantee that an adversary cannot widen the
declassification to launder information. 
%The need for such policies is motivated with a couple of examples below.

In the real-world, such policies find a wide range of applications. For instance, 
in the advertisement example from Listing~\ref{egLeak}, the third-party 
ad service does not need to know the exact age of the viewer for determining 
the preferred advertisement. It is sufficient to know whether the viewer is 
a child or an adult (or a teenager). A similar example is that of a music 
app that hosts advertisements for music shows and concerts in a town. Based
on the age and the preferences of the user, the advertisements might differ 
in each case. 

\begin{lstlisting}[float,caption=Password Checker, label=egpc]
dbPwd $=$ getActualPassword(user);
uPwd $=$ readUserPassword();
login $=$ (dbPwd $==$ uPwd);
\end{lstlisting}

Another common use-case of such policies is user authentication 
based on a secret password or a PIN. The password checker in 
Listing~\ref{egpc} compares the secret password to 
the password entered by the user. The public variable \texttt{login}
reflects whether these match, indicating whether the log-in was
successful. Strict non-interference would normally prohibit 
assignments to the low variable \texttt{login} as the value is 
derived from the secret password. However, releasing the log-in 
status to the user cannot be avoided. Normally, a user can log-in 
in a single try but the probability of an adversary guessing the
correct password in one (or even a few) tries can be
assumed to be negligible when the password is strong and chosen 
randomly~\cite{relSec}. 
%In general, a brute-force attack on the secret would be 
%required, and if the secret is from a large domain then such an 
%attack is not a threat. 
Thus, the assignment to the \texttt{login} variable may be permitted 
for a few tries before the user's account gets locked.
Generally in these applications, there is a trade-off between some 
private information leak and better services.

In practice, certain operations involving Boolean-valued expressions, 
and implicit flows leak very 
little information, which might be required for providing proper
functionality. King \emph{et al.}~\cite{king08implicit} 
investigate the occurrence of implicit flows in some standard 
algorithms and discuss the pros and cons of handling implicit 
flows. Russo \emph{et al.}~\cite{implicit} also observe
that implicit flows cannot be exploited in non-malicious code to 
leak secrets efficiently. The LIR policy is, thus, guided by two key tenets: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Declassification of Boolean-valued expressions.}  As has been
  observed previously~\cite{scd, dta} and is exemplified
  above, comparison operations and other Boolean values often provide a
  low bandwidth channel for information leak. For
  instance, $h \neq l$ only reveals whether the two values in $h$ and
  $l$ are equal or not. Similarly, $h < l$ and $h > l$ only reveal
  that the value of $h$ is lesser and greater than the value of $l$,
  respectively. With LIR, such comparison operations and Boolean-valued  
  expressions are treated as potential points of information release. 
  As all operations need not be declassified, 
  information is released only for those 
  operations that are explicitly annotated with \TT{declassify}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float, caption=Laundering attack via implicit flows, label=lst:laundering]
pub $=$ 0; i $=$ 1;
while (i $\leq 2^{31}$) { @\label{imp:while}@
if ((sec $\&$ i) $==$ i) @\label{imp:if}@
pub $=$ pub $|$ i;
i $=$ i $<<$ 1;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\item \textbf{Bounding the information released.} 
  Unfortunately, allowing information release when
  only an insignificant amount of information is leaked can be widened
  to leak the complete secret~\cite{relSec,delRelease}. 
  The example in Listing~\ref{lst:laundering} is a classical example 
  of a laundering attack. It implicitly leaks the secret value
  in \texttt{sec} to the variable \texttt{pub} without any direct assignments.
  Every time the check on line~\ref{imp:if} is performed, it leaks one
  bit of \texttt{sec}. The whole secret gets implicitly laundered into
  the variable \texttt{pub} as this comparison is performed in a loop of 
  length equal to the size of the secret (in bits).
  
  To limit the amount of information that can be leaked through 
  laundering attacks, LIR introduces a notion of \emph{budget} (a
  natural number) associated with a sensitive value, which is an
  upper bound on the amount of information that is allowed to leak about
  the sensitive value. A budget is associated with every secret in the
  program and defaults to $0$, if left unspecified. 
\end{itemize}

% \medskip
Intuitively, a program is said to satisfy limited information release,
if the information released about the initial value of each secret in
the system is limited by its pre-specified budget. If no information 
is released about any secret or if the budgets for all the secrets 
reduce to $0$, LIR reduces to the standard
non-interference policy. It is important to note that even when
staying within the bounds of the budget one can leak the entire secret
via comparison operations. For instance, if an equality comparison
$h==l$ involving a secret value $h$ and a public value $l$ 
returns \TT{true}, a public adversary knows that the value of $h$ is
the same as the value in $l$. 

Although declassification of only Boolean-valued expressions is 
allowed by LIR, this can be extended to other expressions as well. 
In such cases, where the expression being declassified has a 
data type having $n$ possible values, the leak is 
accounted for by assuming that $\log_{2}n$ bits are leaked. 
As in this paper we consider only Boolean and integer data types, 
we restrict the information release to only Boolean expressions.  
Declassifying an integer value would effectively mean that all bits 
of information about the secret value have been released and the 
secret value could have been simply declassified.
